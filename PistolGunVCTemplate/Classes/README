Problems:
1) to get the phaser sound right. I wanted a phaser sound where you would press the screen and keep emitting a phaser sound.
The accelerometer can't work at the same time as sound. If you leave the accelerometer on the event handler for the touch interface
is not responsive.

The hand phaser sounds were too wimpy. You didn't get the feel it was a real phaser. Found 
a MP3 from the old star trek of the Enterprise space ship firing phasers. Downloaded the FLV from youtube and had to figure out 
how to convert it. Turns out you separate MP3 from FLV, you don't convert. All the internet posts on using ffmpeg to convert
flash video format to mp3 are wrong. 

2) Gun, the sound from a .45 cal pistol is weak. The real sound doesn't give the feel of a gun. Replaced with a rifle shot with 
an echo. 

3) BumpAPI: implemented then took it out. Did this to determine who would win in a quickdraw type play with 2 ipods. Problem
is you have to bump each time you want to play. There is no way to restart the API without connecting to the BumpAPI server.
They should use bluetooth or the network to sync up. There should be a graceful degradation. Bump doesnt give you that. 

4) The pistol gun has the ability for the user to use a wrist action to fire it. People like it. I added a motion to do the loading
and reloading but the sound is too weak to make it satisfying. Took it out.
